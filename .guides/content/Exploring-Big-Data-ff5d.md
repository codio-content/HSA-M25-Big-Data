There are many data sets that are publicly available.  These are a great way to explore the process of data mining and see how a data scientist would go about making inferences based on the available data.

We have downloaded the Social Security Office's record of baby names for every year between 1878 - 2015.  This data contains the first name, gender (M/F) and frequency of each name.  Each year is in a Comma Separated Value (csv) file.

Using Python, we can search the data for a given name, given year, or given popularity.  Perhaps you want to search how many other people have your name from your birth year.  Maybe you want to know how many people have ever had your name (at least in the past century).

Right now, our program is configured to ask for a name and a year, then find the name in the given year and display the important stats about the name.
