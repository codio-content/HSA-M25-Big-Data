Big data may be a record of millions of entries, like the baby names data, but big data can also refer to a continuous stream of live data that we can analyze and see changing in real-time.

In this project, we have put in a call to the Yahoo Application Programming Interface (API) for live stock market data.

Our code calls and displays the data for Apple Computers and displays their current stock price.

{Run Code}(python BigData/StockData.py)

Modify the code to see if you can find additional stock prices.
